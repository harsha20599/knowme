# knowme

- Knowme is a webpage used to create a **dynamic quiz** and share that to friends by a link. 
- Where the link holders can start the quiz by giving their name and their scores are displayed on public leaderboard in the last.

This website is created just to have fun among the friends and relatives. It doesn't intentionally support the raise of issues in any aspect.
